### This program respect PEP8 writing conventions

Be careful: - In your powershell windows, using your right click will automatically paste
	    - In your terminal application for mac or linux use the right click and paste

## PYTHON INSTALLATION:
To run this code you need Python 3.8 version or further 
Download python's executable file on the following website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Lauch the installation without any modification.

## CREATION OF THE WORKING REPOSITORY:
To run this code and find the informations you seek for, you need to create a working folder.
With your explorer go at the place you choose to work, create a new working folder. 

## SET YOUR SYSTEM TO THE RIGHT PLACE (your working folder pathway):
You now need to open your terminal:
- windows: use Windows Powershell(admin). to find it use windows + x as keyboard shortcut 
- mac: use terminal. to find it open your Utilities folder in applications
- linux: use terminal. to find it type terminal in your applications's research bar

In the new window, you have to put your working folder's path
For that go back to your windows explorer, go in your working folder.
now you're in, copy the pathway of your folder found in the adress bar (C:\Users\...\.... for windows)

In the terminal type ```cd ..``` several time. you need to be at the root of your computer (C: for Windows, /Home on Mac)
Next type ```cd 'yourfolderpathwaythatyoujustcopied'``` (keep the small quote marksand let a space after cd) and ENTER

## CREATE A SPECIAL WORKING ENVIRONMENT:
